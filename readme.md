# Identity Server
## What is Identity Server 4 
Identity server is provide many easiness to us. We can define authorization rules. And we can assing this rules to APIs and Clients. As example, client1 can do just read process in ApÄ±2. It provides many facilities like this. We will talk about in detail later. Indentity Server is use OAuth 2 and OpenId Connect protocols. So we are required to know what they are.
#### OAuth 2.0 (Authorization)
OAuth protocols is provide secure authorization for systems like web, mobile. We are seeing many instances in daily life as sign in to any web sites. I will tell many information about OAuth. if you want see about it You can examine <a href="https://oauth.net/2/">here</a>.

#### OpenId Connect (Authentication)
OpenId Connect allows Clients to verify the identity of the End-User based on the authentication performed by an Authorization Server. if you want see about it You can examine <a href="https://openid.net/connect/">here</a>. 

## Some Important Terms
<strong>Resources :</strong> Resources are a series of identity. We will define identity rules inside resource. And we are assign to clients them. As example, we will do define just reading to in API 1 for Client1.  
<strong>Identity Token :</strong> Information about how and when the user authenticated. It can contain additional identity data.      
<strong>Access Token :</strong> We are give token to request. These are contained in client names, base urls, scopes, private key and public key. There are a lot of details, but for now, these concern us. Below is a sample token.

## OAuth 2.0 Grands (Flows)
#### Authorization Code Grant
This is so complicated. But in sum, Resource owner(user) is sending request to identity server with client identifier(username&password). This server can be facebook, twitter authorization servers(identity server) etc. Then server checking client identifier. if it's right it send authorization code(identity token) to client. And when client request to APIs it sending authorization code to authorization servers. Authorization servers is sending back access token and client credential. anymore client can be request to api with access token.

You can read more in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1">here</a> 

#### Implicit Grant
Implicit grant is such as authorization code grant but have a one difference. It's sending one request to authorization server. Authorization server redirection URI with access token and client credential.

#### Resource Owner Credentials Grandt
In this, it sends "resource owner" and "password credentials" information to the authorization server. Authorization server redirection URI with access token and client credential. Such as implicit grant but includes authorization code grant properties.

#### Client credentials grant
It is the simplest of them all. we are send client authentication to authorization server. Then, server is send response to client with access token.

## Identity Endpoints
Identity server is provide a series endpoints. We will by using them communicate with identity server. We will include Http client then request token and info from server. Below I tried to explain some of the "endpoints" that I think significant. Also you can find out more in <a href="https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints/discovery.html">here</a>

#### Discovery Endpoint
Discovery endpoint is a information request. Server response json string to us. Has many info inside of discovery. Such as base url, supported scopes, claims, grant types and response types. Below url is discovery endpoint.
````
https://base-url/.well-known/openid-configuration
````
#### Authorize Endpoint
#### Token Endpoint
#### Introspection Endpoint
#### End Session Endpoint
